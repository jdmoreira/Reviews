# Reviews

ðŸ‘‹

I went a bit overboard and created all the UI programatically without Storyboards.
It was of course not justified for such a small app but this is much more reprensentative of how I usually build UIs nowadays and I thought it would be an interesting convo afterwards.

There are no external dependencies, everything is `UIKit` and `Foundation`.
I missed sending the form POST to save the review and could probably have written some extra logic around `Date` and Unit Tests for that but I was tired already.

I created this in the latest XCode so you will probably need 14+ to open it.

See you soon!
